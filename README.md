GoWiki is a project in early development whose goal is to be a simple and fast wiki that implements the ActivityPub protocol.
The goal is that, unlike with traditional wiki software, different, independent wikis will be able to exchange information and efforts with each other; through the AP protocol,
the editors of one wiki should be able to read, edit, guard and discuss articles hosted on other wikis, and users of other AP platforms, such as Mastodon, should be able to 
interact with wiki posts, for instance, by liking and commenting on them.

We already have a web interface, with some features to be implemented; and are currently working on file uploads and implementing the interfaces defined in 
the [activity](https://pkg.go.dev/code.superseriousbusiness.org/activity) module.

Another federated wiki project is [Ibis](https://github.com/Nutomic/ibis/).
